So central theme is really emergence of data-types

Originally, you passed an args list to a ctor (a tuple - the simplest structuring of values) and after that it was up to the object to take in these values and to behave according to them

over time, the caller has been given more constructive powers (fitting actual usage patterns)

C#3 - anonymous types
C#3 - Object initializers
(above probably related to each other in implementation!)

So for the above, Linq was the driver

What drove tuples?
