* JNK's overview
	not tied to .NET 5! 
  Grpc has been available on DotNet for yonks, since 2016 in fact
	what's new: .NET runtime; gRPC-web

* vs REST
	REST = the contract is discoverable, and resources are exposed
	gRPC - the contract is announced up front, then the calls are imperative (like in-process calls)
	successor to WCF - but simpler, cross-platform
	simplifies design issues - REST = bike-shedding, RPC = no fuss

* Proto contract
	/streaming is first-class-citizen

* Service layer	
	Base classes
	
* HTTP interface

  Distinguish between Grpc and Grpc-Web
	grpc not directly supported by browsers - need to use a special proxy (doable)
  gRPC-Web protocol

	integration with AspNetCore

* BloomRPC
