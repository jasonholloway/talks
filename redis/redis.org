* The Wonderful World of Redis
  
- What is it? A database, a cache, or neither?
  - Intro from 7d7w
  - other intros that clash
- The history:
  - in the beginning, memcache
  - One process per request - cgi-bin, like php
  - Antirez's usecase - tuple aggregation
- Is like a collection library
  - hosted in a peer process rather than as objects on the heap
  - instead of clean and simple method dispatch, you've got a tcp protocol
  - Demo of commands
    - sets the scene for later demos
- The further history
  - NoSQL hype
  - the rebound


- faster writing than reading(?)
- optimized for speed rather than RAM

- originally, used OS fork() to do snapshotting to files
- AOF was added
  
- master->slave async replication


- extension on extension on extension
  - extensions on the inside
    - search
  - extensions on the outside
    - sentinel
    - cluster

- again, as if it's actually a programming environment
  
- single-threaded, good for consistency
  - kinda like Node
  - but the OS is parallelizing loads of stuff underneath
  
- extensions via C (or anything with C bindings)
- Lua acripting ftw
  - all is atomic, transactional
  - script can live in client code
  - show RedisEntityLogs as example
    - predeclare keys so it fetches em upfront
