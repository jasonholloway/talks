* Kubernetes for the Rudderless

** Hooks - a benign parasite of the underlying operating system

** An Operating System from an Operating System
	 but distributed
	 a scheduler?

** V complicated - open to extension!

** Scary diagram
	 only kidding

** Governor
	 Helmsman - hence the logo of a ship's wheel
	 Cybernetics - feedback loops, automatic self-control
	 Governor - self-governing, supposedly 

** But we are the real governors

** A RESTful API, with system behind it making the world match our REST model
	 the pivot is declarative interface
	 behind which imperative code chugs away to meet expectations
	 but for convenience, we use kubectl as tool on top of this
	 though there's also the dashboard UI

** and then behind the API, there are governors running to make sure that the rules we've declared, the real resources we've indicated we want to exist, are actually in place
	 a record of /intent/ - /eventually/ consistent - /desired/ state

** Resources
	 common shape throughout: spec and status

*** VMs with K8s installed (gritty reality)

*** Cluster with Nodes

*** Pods

*** Services and Ingresses

*** Namespaces

*** Deployments and ReplicaSets

** KubeCtl


** Top-down, instead of bottom-up
	 most discussions start with 'what is a container', then 'what is a pod' - we'll get to that shortly enough, but first we need to situate these things
	 the usul path is container first then pod, then the bits and pieces that make sure the right number of pods are in the right places,
