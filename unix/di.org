** Inversion of Control
   three parties: the hardware, the orchestrator, and the 'business logic'
   it's not magic - the DI triangle
   
   in the case of Unix, 
   it wasn't just a program, but a set of tooling and a practice
   
   the C compiler provided the framework
   and Unix code itself was expressed in C, via a small standard library
   
   by programming to this interface, the cost of porting to other systems was minimised
   ie no adhoc reliance on proprietary hardware (because they weren't creating the hardware, had just inherited old machines)
   they started from scraps, but this actually put them at an advantage

   not geniuses but situational, happy circumstances
