Port


AT&T big monopolistic monolith
ironically allowed space at periphery to Bell Labs
pootling about, outside of commercial concerns with absent management
interactions mirrored in interctions of little programs (each of which written by different person or small teams of people)

Cutler macho, as counterpoint

Independent from manufacturers, unusually -> porting removes dependency on particular machine
PDP11 modular itself

porting is kind of Dependency Inversion: different machines are adapted to UNIX via C compilers


AT&T monopoly broken up, which brought Bell labs under commercial pressures, team was split up, etc
Unix became an asset, attempt to monetize it
this broke the spell of the product too; sudden rush to replace it with equivalent

Gnu tried to recreate, but with militance against commercialism and focus on rsm - partial success, kernel failure due to overengineering
Linux beat it, despite bodginess, concurrent with WWW, beginning of open source




communication by text - most primitive, but also most expressive

text is all they had

similarly, lack of languages, at least initially, gave impetus for each small program to interpret its own language






historical progression frames entire thing
first demos are of basics
files, pipes, dsls
