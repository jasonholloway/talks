#+Title: Docker in the Desert: A Testing Mirage
#+Description: The Testing Pyramid often collapses in on itself, especially in the spangly world of Microservices. Luckily, containers are here to pull it all together. Featuring Docker, SqlServer and a variety of camels.

* Pyramids of the World

*** Djoser - Stepped
		[[./images/djoser.jpg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- 2630BC
		- stepped, 'staggering'
		- 6-tier
	  - loads of /mastabas/ stacked
		- earliest collossal mound in Egypt
		- 63m high (almost twice as tall as Stockport pyramid)
		- Djoser was first pharaoh of dynasty, after unification of Upper and Lower Egypt: prosperity
		- previously, Kingdomssplit by cascades of Nile
		- build for him by the demi-god Imhotep
		#+END_NOTES

*** Meidum - Collapsed
		[[./images/meidum-pyramid.jpg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
	  - Huni, son of Djoser, started it; Sneferu carried it on
		- straight, disasterous
		#+END_NOTES

*** Bent Pyramid
		[[./images/bent-pyramid.jpg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- Sneferu's first pyramid 
		- angle and technique of bricklaying changes abruptly half way up
		#+END_NOTES

*** Great Pyramid of Giza - Success
		[[./images/giza3.jpg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- Pyramid of Khufu (bigger), Khafre (slightly smaller) and Menkaure (smaller, damaged)
		- Khafre's retains a cap of polished limestone
		- one of the seven wonders of the world, the only one still standing
		- tallest on earth till 1300AD
		- Khufu was Sneferu's son
		- pyramids after were smaller, cheaper, naffer - few survive

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. 
# -- Alan Kay
# #+END_QUOTE


* The Testing Pyramid
*** Pyramid
		[[./images/testpyramid.1.png]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- devised by Mike Cohn in 2009(AD)
		- ambiguity of axes
		#+END_NOTES

*** Teardrop
		[[./images/teardrop.svg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- tautological tests very low value, with high maintenance
			taper off towards nothing
		- sweetspot!
		#+END_NOTES
*** Onion
		[[./images/onion.svg]]
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- tests above and around ease refactoring
		- tests below are like concrete
		- reflects structure of implementation - simpler software at a courser granularity
		#+END_NOTES
*** Spinning Top
		[[./images/spinningtop.svg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
	- SQLServer in particular! ******
  - microservices pushing the horizontal line down
	- previously HTTP pipeline was a barrier; not so anymore
	- but in general, Processes outside of CLR
#+END_NOTES
*** So...
		#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t t t t)
		- sharp boundary, above which tests decay
		- microservices push boundary down further
		- pyramid collapses into its base
		- it'd be nice if...
			- mid-range testing: cheaper!
			- external resources: more like CLR!

* Process Wrangling
	#+BEGIN_NOTES
	- What is Docker? needs to be asked here 
	- not just processes, but resources
	#+END_NOTES
** Camel Market
	[[./images/camel-market2.jpg]]
	#+BEGIN_NOTES
	- contention
	- unpreparedness
	- lacks isolation
	- lacks reliability
	- lacks snappiness
	#+END_NOTES

** Ready to Ride
	[[./images/camels-pool.jpg]]

** Docker	
	#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="width:100%">
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="float:left;width:50%">
	 [[./images/docker.jpg]]
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="float:right;width:50%;padding-top:50px;">
	 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t t t)
	 - each process in its own little world: *isolated*
	 - environments made up of immutable layers: *reproducible*
	 - well-used tooling hiding complexities of deployment: *convenient*
	 - potentially, very *realistic*
		#+BEGIN_NOTES
		- so... external resources made manageable
		#+END_NOTES 
		#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>


** SqlServer, on Docker
	 #+BEGIN_NOTES
	 - SqlServer basically an OS in itself - bypasses stuff
	 - https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server
	 - (even has /Temporary Internet Files/ folder inside the container)
	 #+END_NOTES
	 - ported to Linux by Microsoft in 2017
	 - free for non-production use
	 - nestled inside experimental /Drawbridge/ process - like a small enclave of virtual Windows
	 - so SqlServer inside Drawbridge inside Docker inside...

** Demo

** Convenient but slow-ish

* The Mirage
** CRIU: Checkpoint/Restore
	#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="width:100%">
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="float:left;width:50%">
	 [[./images/criu.svg]]
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="float:right;width:50%;padding-top:50px">
	 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t t t)
	 - freezes and unfreezes entire groups of processes, all at once!
	 - main use case: live migrations between hosts
	 - but - can be used for fast bootups too
	 #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
	#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

	#+BEGIN_NOTES
	- criogenics vs phoenix from flames
	- https://criu.org/Main_Page
  - v much criogenics - think wiring up a brain(?); *Software Criogenics*
	- 2011 - same era as Docker (2013) and Drawbridge
	- made by people who worked on Virtuozzo project, with forked kernel etc
  - other C/R implementations, all involving customized kernels
  - other use cases: diagnostics
	- impossible for it to be perfect, as too many uncontrolled bits (tho, with more kernel integration...)
	- but, if the capture works once, it can be repeated
