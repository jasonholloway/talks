#+Title: Pyramids

* Integration Testing through the Ages

** Pyramids of the World
	 Replete with pictures of pyramids, right here	

*** Egyptian Pyramid	
		- imposing simplicity at scale
		- an expression of the slave labour system
		- mass of coupled balls of mud, a pile of compressed mud

*** Stockport Pyramid
		- being honest, just to fill the gap of pyramid #2, but...
		- in place of outdated social housing, to stand next to extended motorway
		- original developer had planned an entire 'valley' of kings
		- but went bust after erecting one

*** Testing Pyramid
		- from Mike Cohn's /Succeeding with Agile/ (2009?)
			(Cohn himself has blog post about the 'missing' layer of the pyramid,the middle one - like the pyramid has only one dimension)
