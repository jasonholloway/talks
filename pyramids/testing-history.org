* History of Testing

** DZone Article thing - Leah Grantz
	 - developer market opened up with miniturization and internet, code quality declined as it was democratised: specialisation of testers as QA gatekeepers
		 ! but devs were previously higher value, and bugs were always a great problem
		 ! seems that specialized QAs must always have been a thing at any kind of scale: unit testing is dev-led QA, a retreat back to the small scale, enabled by miniaturisation
	 - mentions testing of other industries:
		 - fashion's /toiles/ - working patterned garments made of cheap fabrics
			 ! but isn't this outside in integration testing with MVPs?
		 - per-department continuity testing in filmmaking
		 ! this kind of stuff, in that it's testing not of the whole, but of cohesive cross-cutting aspects of the whole, does not match OO modularisation

	 - supposed phases:
		 - primordial /Debugging-oriented/
		 - /Demonstration-oriented/
		 - /Destruction-oriented/
		 - /Evaluation-oriented/
		 - /Prevention-oriented/
			 
			 ! but all above are unfolded from the first, which is local and unspecialised, but complete
			 ! demos needed to convince customers, then coopted to prove to self via destruction, which was formalised as evaluation, then with improvements came prevention
